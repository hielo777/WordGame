# WordGame 🎮🧠

**WordGame** is a simple project built using [Construct 3](https://www.construct.net/) that serves as the foundation for a word-based puzzle game. It currently demonstrates how to efficiently load and parse a large English word list (over 200,000 words) from a text file.

This repository is intended for learning, experimenting, and eventually expanding into a fully playable word game.
